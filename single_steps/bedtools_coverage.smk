'''
Quick and dirty rule to output BAM mean coverage over intervals from BED file with bedtools
Using bedtools coverage, consult docs for how to modify command line to see what else it can do and chop and change at this
As I've currently set up:
1. Reports per-base strand-specific coverage on each nucleotide in each interval in BED (or GFF) file
2. Additionally computes mean & median (separately) coverage for each interval (bedtools groupby)
